  <h2>My Top 5 Favorite things about living in Sydney</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Amazing weather all the time! They have a very tropical climate so it never gets too cold.</li>
      <li>The outstanding diversity of nature you can find all across the country.</li>
      <li>Its deep history that resembles the United States' in some ways, and is unique in others</li>
      <li>The national attitude is much more laid back and less focused on intense competetition like it is here.</li>
      <li>Diversity of people! While its helpful that the national language is English, the cities I visited were some of the most ethnically diverse I have ever seen!</li>

  <h2>Studying Abroad Advice</h2>
    <p>Choosing to study abroad has been one of the highlights of my college experience and I would absolutely reccommend anyone who is able to to consider it! Especially here at UW, there are countless options across the globe for broadening your horizons and applying your studies at home to a brand new environment and context.<p>
    <p>Living overseas can certainly be an uncertain and scary idea to some, especially if you've never done it before. Even if you go to a country where you speak the language, there will undoubtably be some culture shock as well as some homesickness. However, I would certainly not let this discourage you! This culture shock will eventually turn to familiarity, and you can't forget that your fellow students in your program are going through the exact same thing as you! Just like the beginning of your freshman year in college, things may start out slow, but the more you meet people and learn your surroundings, the more enriching and exciting the experience will become!</p>
