  <h1>The Indigenous Aboriginal Peoples of Australia</h1>
  

  <h2>Australia has a history with their native peoples very similar to the United States'.</h2>


    <p>The Aborignes in Australia are made up of hundreds of regional groups with their own cultures, customs and languages. Today there are much fewer Indigenous people in Australia, and many groups and languagese are considered endangered. Just as colonizers did in the Americas, European settlers committed acts of displacement and genocide against the Aboriginal people.</p>
    <p>I do find it interesting though that Australians have a much more honest, open, and direct relationship with this terrible past than we do in America. I was very pleasantly surprised to learn that in most public events, whoever is speaking or performing will first state something known as "Acknowledgement of Country" in which they will state by name the Aboriginal Nation whose land we are currently standing on, and then say a statement that usually goes "We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of Country throughout Australia and recognise their continuing connection to land, waters and culture. We pay our respects to their Elders past, present and emerging." This open acknowledgement of the country's past transgressions was a learning experience for me and something I think the US would certainly benefit from.</p>
    <p>However, it is important to remember that these people should not be only defined by their past relation to colonizers; they are a diverse group of people with customs and cultures that are fascinating and beautiful, and some of my favorite moments in Australia were getting to engage with and learn more about these people.
